Always a riddle in the world she says
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder the way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me, yeah it's a big old world indeed
Everyone is killing me and everything conspires
Oh in dreams I have watched it spin
Seen a violent crack of atoms were all that comes in
Oh in dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for
How can I ask, ask for more?
Always a riddle in the world she says
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder in the way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me yeah
It's a big old world indeed
Kicking my heels and wondering how I've been here so long
Oh in dreams I have watched it spin
Seen a violent crack of atoms were all that comes in
Oh in dreams I saw Aesop's kin
Just a carcass of a man, I belong inside his skin
Mmmm mmmmm mmmm
Where to, where to begin?
I live alone, I live a lonely life without you
And I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat
Oh I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat
